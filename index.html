    <h2></h2>
    <p>I am a 17 year old boy that attends Manhattan Hunter Science High School. I currently live in Bronx, Ny, where i was born and raised.I attend P.S.71 middle school in the Bronx and was accepted to Hunter 3 years ago, meaning I am now a junior. Although I am very pleased with where I am as a student today, I originally never planned on attending Hunter. I originally saw myself attending a private school or specialized High School, but after much hard thinking, I chose to give Hunter a try. I slowly came to realize that Hunter would not only build me as a student, but slowly mold me into the productive young adult that I always aspired to be. But now, back to the present; when I'm not in school, I tend to hang out with friends and family, taking part in either get-togethers and sometimes sports activities. 
   </p>
    <h3>My hobbies/passtime activities</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>Playing soccer with cousins and friends.</li>
     <li>Playing video games with my friend Blendon.</li>
     <li>Expirimenting with interesting websites/interfaces.</li>
     <li>Watching Premier League matches with my father.</li>
     <li>Occasionally driving around with friends and family when going to malls or smaller gatherings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>My Main Goals</h4>
    
    <p>My main academic long-term academic career goal is to achieve a Ph.D. in accounting once I fully complete my school career. Following that, I hope to have started up my own accounting firm, giving me room to pursue some other extra hobbies and potentially produce something of my own, whether it be a specific product or concept.
